# Algorithm I - Assignment 3

This assignment objective was the pratice of Dynamic programming using C++.<br>
The cenario was the implementantion of a optimized path on a apple farm.<br>
Using Dynamic programming, it is possible to find the path that collect the biggest amount of apples.<br>

The Algorithm is below:<br>
* Given a N x M matrix, the algorithm run throught each matrix cell, adding the biggest value from the adjacent cells from the line above. The below image show a example:
